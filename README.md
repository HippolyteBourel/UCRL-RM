Code for our paper: Exploration in Reward Machines with Low Regret, by Bourel, Jonnson, Maillard and Talebi. AISTATS 2023

The experiments_neurips folder contains functional but slightly dated experiments, the README in the folder give instructions to run the code.
Overall this code cover the experiments presented in our Workshop paper/poster (DARL ICML2022).

The code from our AISTATS 2023 paper will be uploaded in the comming weeks (some follow-up work need to be cleaned before release).
